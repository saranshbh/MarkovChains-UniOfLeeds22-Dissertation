\chapter{Appendix Chapter}

A lot of research has gone into improving textual models with Neural Networks and in some ways, Markov Models were the stepping stones for their interconnected layers. Following are some links that could be a good read for anyone wishing to delve deeper into this research.

Please note that these links are not references, and thus, have been kept separate from the Bibliography section. This appendix is added so as to help in further research in the topic if needed.
